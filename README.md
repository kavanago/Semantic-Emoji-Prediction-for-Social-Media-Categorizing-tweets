# Semantic-Emoji-Prediction-for-Social-Media-Categorizing-tweets
This project presents a deep learning–based approach to predict semantic emoji categories from tweet text. Instead of predicting individual emojis, the study groups more than 100 emojis into five meaningful categories: Love, Hype, Gesture, Emotion, and Celebrate. This reduces class imbalance and improves interpretability.
